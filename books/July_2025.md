## 3607. Power Grid Maintenance [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/power-grid-maintenance

## Description

You are given an integer `c` representing `c` power stations, each with a unique identifier `id` from 1 to `c` (1‑based indexing).

These stations are interconnected via `n` **bidirectional** cables, represented by a 2D array `connections`, where each element `connections[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates a connection between station `u_i` and station `v_i`. Stations that are directly or indirectly connected form a **power grid**.

Initially, **all** stations are online (operational).

You are also given a 2D array `queries`, where each query is one of the following two types:

- `[1, x]`: A maintenance check is requested for station `x`. If station `x` is online, it resolves the check by itself. If station `x` is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest `id` in the same **power grid** as `x`. If **no** operational station exists in that grid, return -1.
- `[2, x]`: Station `x` goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational).

Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type `[1, x]` in the **order** they appear.

**Note:** The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking it offline does not alter connectivity.

**Examples**

**Example 1:**

Input: c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]]

Output: [3,2,3]

Explanation:
- Initially, all stations {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are online and form a single power grid.
- Query [1,3]: Station 3 is online, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 3.
- Query [2,1]: Station 1 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {2, 3, 4, 5}.
- Query [1,1]: Station 1 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {2, 3, 4, 5}, which is station 2.
- Query [2,2]: Station 2 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {3, 4, 5}.
- Query [1,2]: Station 2 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {3, 4, 5}, which is station 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: c = 3, connections = [], queries = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]]

Output: [1,-1]

Explanation:
- There are no connections, so each station is its own isolated grid.
- Query [1,1]: Station 1 is online in its isolated grid, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 1.
- Query [2,1]: Station 1 goes offline.
- Query [1,1]: Station 1 is offline and there are no other stations in its grid, so the result is -1.

**Constraints**
```tex
1 <= c <= 10^5
0 <= n == connections.length <= min(10^5, c * (c - 1) / 2)
connections[i].length == 2
1 <= u_i, v_i <= c
u_i != v_i
1 <= queries.length <= 2 * 10^5
queries[i].length == 2
queries[i][0] is either 1 or 2.
1 <= queries[i][1] <= c
```

## Explanation

### Strategy

Let's restate the problem:
- We have a set of power stations connected by cables, forming one or more power grids (connected components).
- Each station can go offline, but the grid structure does not change.
- For a maintenance check, if the station is online, it handles the check; if offline, the smallest online station in the same grid handles it (or -1 if none).

**Type:** Graph, Union Find, Heap, DFS, Ordered Set

**What is being asked?**
- Efficiently answer queries about which station can handle a maintenance check, considering online/offline status and grid structure.

**What is given?**
- Number of stations, connections, and a list of queries.

**Constraints/Edge Cases:**
- Up to 10^5 stations and 2*10^5 queries.
- Stations can go offline, but the grid structure is static.

**High-Level Plan:**
- Precompute connected components (power grids) using DFS or Union Find (DSU).
- For each component, maintain a data structure (set, heap, or sorted list) of online stations.
- For type 1 queries, if the station is online, return it; otherwise, return the smallest online station in its component, or -1 if none.
- For type 2 queries, mark the station as offline (remove from set/heap/list or mark in a boolean array).

### Steps

1. **Build the graph and find connected components:**
   - Use DFS or DSU to assign each station a component ID.
2. **For each component, track online stations:**
   - Use a set, heap, or sorted list for fast lookup of the smallest online station.
3. **Process queries:**
   - For `[1, x]`, if `x` is online, return `x`; else, return the smallest online station in the same component, or -1 if none.
   - For `[2, x]`, mark `x` as offline.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Suppose c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]]

- All stations are online and form a single grid.
- [1,3]: 3 is online → return 3
- [2,1]: 1 goes offline
- [1,1]: 1 is offline, smallest online in grid is 2 → return 2
- [2,2]: 2 goes offline
- [1,2]: 2 is offline, smallest online in grid is 3 → return 3

> **Note:** The grid structure is static; only online/offline status changes.

### Solution

```python
def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n + 1))

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px != py:
            self.parent[py] = px


class Solution:
    def processQueries(self, n, connections, queries):
        dsu = DSU(n)
        online = [True] * (n + 1)
        for u, v in connections:
            dsu.union(u, v)
        component_heap = defaultdict(list)
        for station in range(1, n + 1):
            root = dsu.find(station)
            heapq.heappush(component_heap[root], station)
        result = []
        for typ, x in queries:
            if typ == 2:
                online[x] = False
            else:
                if online[x]:
                    result.append(x)
                else:
                    root = dsu.find(x)
                    heap = component_heap[root]
                    while heap and not online[heap[0]]:
                        heapq.heappop(heap)
                    result.append(heap[0] if heap else -1)
        return result
```

### Explanation

## 3608. Minimum Time for K Connected Components [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-for-k-connected-components

## Description
You are given an integer n and an undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i] indicates an undirected edge between nodes u_i and v_i that can be removed at time_i.

You are also given an integer k.

Initially, the graph may be connected or disconnected. Your task is to find the minimum time t such that after removing all edges with time <= t, the graph contains at least k connected components.

Return the minimum time t.

A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

## Examples

**Example 1**
Input:
n = 2
edges = [[0,1,3]]
k = 2

Output:
3

Explanation:
- Initially, there is one connected component {0, 1}.
- At time = 1 or 2, the graph remains unchanged.
- At time = 3, edge [0, 1] is removed, resulting in k = 2 connected components {0}, {1}. Thus, the answer is 3.

**Example 2**
Input:
n = 3
edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4]]
k = 3

Output:
4

Explanation:
- Initially, there is one connected component {0, 1, 2}.
- At time = 2, edge [0, 1] is removed, resulting in two connected components {0}, {1, 2}.
- At time = 4, edge [1, 2] is removed, resulting in k = 3 connected components {0}, {1}, {2}. Thus, the answer is 4.

**Example 3**
Input:
n = 3
edges = [[0,2,5]]
k = 2

Output:
0

Explanation:
- Since there are already k = 2 disconnected components {1}, {0, 2}, no edge removal is needed. Thus, the answer is 0.

## Constraints
```
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= edges.length <= 10^5
- edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i]
- 0 <= u_i, v_i < n
- u_i != v_i
- 1 <= time_i <= 10^9
- 1 <= k <= n
- There are no duplicate edges.
```

## Explanation

**Intuition**

We want to find the minimum time t such that, after removing all edges with time <= t, the graph splits into at least k connected components. This is a classic application of binary search combined with union-find (DSU) to efficiently count components after edge removals.

**Approach**

1. **Binary Search:**
   - Sort all unique edge times and use binary search to find the smallest t such that the number of connected components is at least k after removing all edges with time <= t.
2. **Union-Find (DSU):**
   - For each candidate t, use union-find to connect all nodes with edges having time > t, then count the number of connected components.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the initial graph already has at least k components, return 0.

### Solution

```python
def count_components(n, edges_by_time, t):
    parent = list(range(n))

    def find(x):
        while parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]
            x = parent[x]
        return x

    def union(x, y):
        px, py = find(x), find(y)
        if px != py:
            parent[py] = px

    for u, v, time in edges_by_time:
        if time > t:
            union(u, v)
    comps = set(find(i) for i in range(n))
    return len(comps)


class Solution:
    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        if k == n:
            return 0
        if not edges:
            return 0 if k <= n else -1
        edges_by_time = sorted(edges, key=lambda x: x[2])
        lo, hi = 0, max(e[2] for e in edges)
        ans = hi
        while lo <= hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            comps = count_components(n, edges_by_time, mid)
            if comps >= k:
                ans = mid
                hi = mid - 1
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return ans
```

## 3623. Count Number of Trapezoids I [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-trapezoids-i

### Explanation

## 3623. Count Number of Trapezoids I [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-trapezoids-i

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the coordinates of the `i`-th point on the Cartesian plane.

A **horizontal trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair** of horizontal sides (i.e., parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

Return the number of unique **horizontal trapezoids** that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** 10^9 + 7.

**Examples**

**Example 1:**

Input:
points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]

Output: 3

Explanation:
There are three distinct ways to pick four points that form a horizontal trapezoid:
- Using points [1,0], [2,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
- Using points [2,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
- Using points [1,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].

Output: 1

Explanation:
There is only one horizontal trapezoid that can be formed.

**Constraints**

```tex
4 <= points.length <= 10^5
-10^8 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^8
All points are pairwise distinct.
```

## Explanation

### Strategy

Let's restate the problem:
- We are given a set of points on a 2D plane.
- We want to count the number of ways to pick 4 distinct points that form a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e., two sides parallel to the x-axis).

**Type:** Geometry, Combinatorics, Hash Map

**What is being asked?**
- Count the number of unique horizontal trapezoids (convex quadrilaterals with at least one pair of horizontal sides) that can be formed from the given points.

**What is given?**
- A list of points, all distinct.

**Constraints/Edge Cases:**
- Large input size (up to 10^5 points).
- All points are distinct.

**Why is the naive approach too slow?**
- The naive approach groups points by y-coordinate, then for every pair of y-levels, multiplies the number of ways to pick 2 points from each. This is O(K^2) where K is the number of y-levels with at least 2 points. For large K, this is too slow and leads to TLE.

**Optimized Plan:**
- Instead of iterating over all pairs, use the mathematical identity:
  - The total number of unordered pairs of y-levels is C(K,2).
  - If we precompute the number of ways to pick 2 points from each y-level (call this list `pairs`), then the sum over all pairs is:
    - sum_{i<j} pairs[i] * pairs[j] = (total_sum^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2
  - Where total_sum = sum(pairs), sum_of_squares = sum(x*x for x in pairs).
- This reduces the time complexity to O(N + K), which is efficient for large inputs.

### Steps

1. **Group points by y-coordinate:**
   - Use a hash map to group all points with the same y.
2. **For each group, count the number of ways to pick 2 points:**
   - For a group of size c, the number of ways to pick 2 points is C(c, 2) = c * (c-1) // 2.
   - Only consider groups with at least 2 points.
3. **Sum up all C(c,2) values:**
   - Let `pairs` be the list of C(c,2) for each y-level with at least 2 points.
4. **Compute the total number of trapezoids:**
   - Use the formula: res = (total_sum^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2
   - Return res modulo 10^9 + 7.

> **Note:**
> - We only consider y-levels with at least 2 points.
> - The order of y-levels does not matter (unordered pairs).
> - This approach avoids the O(K^2) double loop and is much faster.

#### Example Walkthrough
Suppose points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]
- y=0: [1,0], [2,0], [3,0] (3 points)
- y=2: [2,2], [3,2] (2 points)
- C(3,2) = 3, C(2,2) = 1
- pairs = [3, 1]
- total_sum = 4, sum_of_squares = 9 + 1 = 10
- res = (4*4 - 10) // 2 = (16 - 10) // 2 = 3

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + K), where N is the number of points and K is the number of y-levels with at least 2 points.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for storing the groups.

```tex
| Step | Operation         | Count |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 1    | Group points by y | N     |
| 2    | Compute C(c,2)    | K     |
| 3    | Math formula      | K     |
```

### Solution

```python
def countTrapezoids(points):
    y_groups = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        y_groups[y] += 1
    pairs = []
    for c in y_groups.values():
        if c >= 2:
            pairs.append(c * (c - 1) // 2)
    total_sum = sum(pairs)
    sum_of_squares = sum(x * x for x in pairs)
    res = (total_sum * total_sum - sum_of_squares) // 2
    return res % MOD
```
