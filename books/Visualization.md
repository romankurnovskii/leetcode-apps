## 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies [Easy]

https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies

## Description
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

**Examples**
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]

**Constraints**
```
- n == candies.length
- 2 <= n <= 100
- 1 <= candies[i] <= 100
- 1 <= extraCandies <= 50
```

## Hint
For each kid, check if their candies plus extraCandies is at least as much as the current maximum.

## Explanation
First, we want to know the highest number of candies any kid currently has. This is important because we need a reference point to see if giving extra candies to a kid will make them "the greatest."

For each kid, we add the extraCandies to their current amount. We do this because we want to see if, after the bonus, they can reach or beat the current maximum. If they do, we mark them as True in our answer list; otherwise, False.

This approach is efficient because we only need to find the maximum once, and then just compare each kid's total to it. This saves us from recalculating the maximum for every kid, making our solution faster and cleaner.

### Solution

```python
def kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies):
    max_candies = max(candies)  # Find the current maximum
    return [(c + extraCandies) >= max_candies for c in candies]
```

### Explanation

## 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs

## Description
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

**Examples**
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

**Constraints**
```
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= k <= 10^9
```

## Hint
Use a hash map to count occurrences and find pairs efficiently.

## Explanation
Imagine you have a bag of numbers and you want to make as many pairs as possible that add up to k. For each number, check if you have seen its complement (k - number) before. If so, you can make a pair! Use a hash map to keep track of the numbers you have seen and how many are left.

This approach is efficient because it lets you find pairs in a single pass through the array.

### Solution

```python
def function_name(...):
    pass
```

## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately [Easy]
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately

### Explanation

## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately [Easy]

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately

## Description
You are given two strings, word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

**Examples**
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a    b 
word2:     p    q   r   s
merged: a p b q  r   s

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

**Constraints**
```tex
- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
```

## Hint
In most cases, LeetCode Easy problems have a straightforward solution that can be derived from the description or the examples provided.

## Explanation
Imagine you have two strings, like two lines of colored beads. You want to make a new necklace by picking one bead from the first string, then one from the second, and keep going! If one string runs out, just add the rest from the other.

We use two pointers to keep track of our position in each string, because this lets us alternate letters easily and ensures we don't miss any. By appending the remaining part of the longer string at the end, we make sure no letters are left out—this is important for correctness, especially when the strings are different lengths.

**Example:**

word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"  
- Take 'a' and 'p' → "ap"
- Take 'b' and 'q' → "apbq"
- word1 is done, so add the rest of word2: "rs"
- Final answer: "apbqrs"

We use a list to collect the letters because lists in Python are efficient for appending, and then join them at the end for the final string.

### Solution

```python
def mergeAlternately(word1, word2):
    res = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(word1) and i < len(word2):
        res.append(word1[i])
        res.append(word2[i])
        i += 1
    res.append(word1[i:])
    res.append(word2[i:])
    return "".join(res)
```

## 1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-consecutive-values-you-can-make

### Explanation

## 1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-consecutive-values-you-can-make

## Description

You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the `n` coins that you own. The value of the `i`th coin is `coins[i]`. You can **make** some value `x` if you can choose some of your `n` coins such that their values sum up to `x`.

Return the *maximum number of consecutive integer values that you **can** **make** with your coins **starting** from and **including** 0*.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.

**Examples**

**Example 1:**

    Input: coins = [1,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You can make the following values:
    - 0: take []
    - 1: take [1]
    You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.

**Example 2:**

    Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
    Output: 8
    Explanation: You can make the following values:
    - 0: take []
    - 1: take [1]
    - 2: take [1,1]
    - 3: take [1,1,1]
    - 4: take [4]
    - 5: take [4,1]
    - 6: take [4,1,1]
    - 7: take [4,1,1,1]
    You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.

**Example 3:**

    Input: coins = [1,4,10,3,1]
    Output: 20

**Constraints**

```
coins.length == n
1 <= n <= 4 * 10^4
1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 10^4
```

## Explanation

### Strategy

Let's restate the problem:
- You have a set of coins, each with a positive integer value.
- You can use any subset of these coins (including none) to make sums.
- What is the largest number of *consecutive* values (starting from 0) you can make?

Consecutive is 0, 1, 2, ... So when you have coins `[1,2,3]`:

    - sum of them is 6
    - consecutive sequence will be up to `6` starting from `0`: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6` 

**Type:** Array, Greedy, Sorting

**What is given:**
- An array of positive integers (the coin values).

**What is asked:**
- The maximum number of consecutive values (starting from 0) you can make by summing up any subset of the coins.

**Constraints/Edge Cases:**
- Coins can have repeated values.
- The array can be large (up to 40,000 elements).
- All coin values are at least 1.

**High-level plan:**
- Sort the coins in ascending order.
- Track the smallest value you *cannot* make yet (let's call it `res`, start at 1).
- For each coin:
    - If the coin is greater than `res`, you can't make `res` (or anything larger), so stop.
    - Otherwise, you can now make all values up to `res + coin - 1`, so update `res += coin`.
- Return `res`.

### Steps

Let's walk through an example: `coins = [1, 1, 1, 4]`

1. **Sort the coins:** `[1, 1, 1, 4]`
2. **Initialize `res = 1`** (the smallest value we can't make yet)
3. **First coin (1):**
    - 1 <= (sequence value 1), so we can make 1. Now we can make all values up to 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.
    - Update `res = 2`.
4. **Second coin (1):**
    - 1 <= (sequence value 2), so we can make 2. Now we can make up to 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.
    - Update `res = 3`.
5. **Third coin (1):**
    - 1 <= (sequence value 3), so we can make 3. Now we can make up to 3 + 1 - 1 = 3.
    - Update `res = 4`.
6. **Fourth coin (4):**
    - 4 <= (sequence value 4), so we can make 4. Now we can make up to 4 + 4 - 1 = 7.
    - Update `res = 8`.
7. **No more coins.**

So, we can make all values from 0 to 7 (8 values).

**Another example:** `coins = [1, 3]`
- Sort: [1, 3]
- res = 1
- First coin: 1 <= 1 → res = 2
- Second coin: 3 > 2 → stop
- Answer: 2

**Key insight:**
> If you ever encounter a coin that is greater than the smallest value you can't make yet, you can't fill the gap, so you must stop.

### Solution

```python
def getMaximumConsecutive(coins):
    res = 1
    for coin in sorted(coins):
        if coin > res:
            break
        res += coin
    return res
```

### Explanation

## 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays [Easy]

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays

## Description
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:
- answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
- answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.

**Examples**
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
Output: [[3],[]]

**Constraints**
- 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
- -1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

## Hint
Use sets to efficiently find unique elements in each array.

## Explanation
Let's imagine you have two boxes of colored marbles (numbers). You want to find out which colors are only in the first box and which are only in the second. We use sets to quickly check for unique marbles in each box.

We do this because sets make it easy and fast to find differences—checking if something is in a set is much quicker than searching through a list. By converting the lists to sets, we can use set operations to get the answer efficiently.

### Solution

```python
def findDifference(nums1, nums2):
    set1, set2 = set(nums1), set(nums2)
    return [list(set1 - set2), list(set2 - set1)]
```

## 3623. Count Number of Trapezoids I [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-trapezoids-i

### Explanation

## 3623. Count Number of Trapezoids I [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-trapezoids-i

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the coordinates of the `i`-th point on the Cartesian plane.

A **horizontal trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair** of horizontal sides (i.e., parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

Return the number of unique **horizontal trapezoids** that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** 10^9 + 7.

**Examples**

**Example 1:**

Input:
points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]

Output: 3

Explanation:
There are three distinct ways to pick four points that form a horizontal trapezoid:
- Using points [1,0], [2,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
- Using points [2,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
- Using points [1,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].

Output: 1

Explanation:
There is only one horizontal trapezoid that can be formed.

![Trapezoid Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/04/29/desmos-graph-5.png)

**Constraints**

```tex
4 <= points.length <= 10^5
-10^8 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^8
All points are pairwise distinct.
```

## Explanation

### Strategy

Let's restate the problem:
- We are given a set of points on a 2D plane.
- We want to count the number of ways to pick 4 distinct points that form a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e., two sides parallel to the x-axis).

**Type:** Geometry, Combinatorics, Hash Map

**What is being asked?**
- Count the number of unique horizontal trapezoids (convex quadrilaterals with at least one pair of horizontal sides) that can be formed from the given points.

**What is given?**
- A list of points, all distinct.

**Constraints/Edge Cases:**
- Large input size (up to 10^5 points).
- All points are distinct.

**Why is the naive approach too slow?**
- The naive approach groups points by y-coordinate, then for every pair of y-levels, multiplies the number of ways to pick 2 points from each. This is O(K^2) where K is the number of y-levels with at least 2 points. For large K, this is too slow and leads to TLE.

**Optimized Plan:**
- Instead of iterating over all pairs, use the mathematical identity:
  - The total number of unordered pairs of y-levels is C(K,2).
  - If we precompute the number of ways to pick 2 points from each y-level (call this list `pairs`), then the sum over all pairs is:
    - sum_{i<j} pairs[i] * pairs[j] = (total_sum^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2
  - Where total_sum = sum(pairs), sum_of_squares = sum(x*x for x in pairs).
- This reduces the time complexity to O(N + K), which is efficient for large inputs.

### Steps

1. **Group points by y-coordinate:**
   - Use a hash map to group all points with the same y.
2. **For each group, count the number of ways to pick 2 points:**
   - For a group of size c, the number of ways to pick 2 points is C(c, 2) = c * (c-1) // 2.
   - Only consider groups with at least 2 points.
3. **Sum up all C(c,2) values:**
   - Let `pairs` be the list of C(c,2) for each y-level with at least 2 points.
4. **Compute the total number of trapezoids:**
   - Use the formula: res = (total_sum^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2
   - Return res modulo 10^9 + 7.

> **Note:**
> - We only consider y-levels with at least 2 points.
> - The order of y-levels does not matter (unordered pairs).
> - This approach avoids the O(K^2) double loop and is much faster.

#### Example Walkthrough
Suppose points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]
- y=0: [1,0], [2,0], [3,0] (3 points)
- y=2: [2,2], [3,2] (2 points)
- C(3,2) = 3, C(2,2) = 1
- pairs = [3, 1]
- total_sum = 4, sum_of_squares = 9 + 1 = 10
- res = (4*4 - 10) // 2 = (16 - 10) // 2 = 3

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + K), where N is the number of points and K is the number of y-levels with at least 2 points.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for storing the groups.

```tex
| Step | Operation         | Count |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 1    | Group points by y | N     |
| 2    | Compute C(c,2)    | K     |
| 3    | Math formula      | K     |
```

### Solution

```python
def countTrapezoids(points):
    y_groups = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        y_groups[y] += 1
    pairs = []
    for c in y_groups.values():
        if c >= 2:
            pairs.append(c * (c - 1) // 2)
    total_sum = sum(pairs)
    sum_of_squares = sum(x * x for x in pairs)
    res = (total_sum * total_sum - sum_of_squares) // 2
    return res % MOD
```
