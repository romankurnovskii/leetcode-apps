## 1. Two Sum [Easy]
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

### Explanation

To solve the Two Sum problem, we want to find two numbers in the array that add up to a given target. The most efficient way is to use a hash map (dictionary) to store the numbers we have seen so far and their indices. As we iterate through the array, for each number, we check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map. If it does, we have found the solution. Otherwise, we add the current number and its index to the hash map. This approach has O(n) time complexity.

## Hint

Try using a hash map to keep track of the numbers you have seen so far and their indices.

## Points

- Time complexity: O(n) using a hash map.
- Brute-force solution is O(n^2) and not efficient for large arrays.
- There is always exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- Be careful with duplicate numbers in the array.

### Solution

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """Find two numbers that add up to target using a hash map for O(n) time complexity."""
    num_to_index = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_to_index:
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        num_to_index[num] = i
    return []
```

## 2. Add Two Numbers [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

### Explanation

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
```text
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

Constraints:
```text
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
```

## Explanation

The Add Two Numbers problem involves adding two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. To solve this, we iterate through both linked lists, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition. We create a new linked list to store the result. If one list is shorter, treat missing digits as 0. If there is a carry left after processing both lists, add a new node with the carry value.

## Hint

Use a dummy head node to simplify the code for building the result list. Remember to handle the carry at the end.

## Points

- Time complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.
- Handle different lengths of input lists.
- Don’t forget to add a node if there is a carry left after the main loop.
- Each node contains a single digit (0-9).

### Solution

```python
def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

## 11. Container With Most Water [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

### Explanation

## 11. Container With Most Water [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

## Description

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Examples:

```raw
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
```

> **Hint:**  Use two pointers, one at each end, and move the pointer with the shorter line inward.

## Explanation

Imagine the array as a row of sticks of different heights. You want to pick two sticks that, together with the x-axis, can hold the most water. The area is determined by the shorter stick and the distance between them. Start with the two ends and move the pointer pointing to the shorter stick inward, always looking for a bigger area.

This approach is efficient because it checks all possible pairs in linear time, always keeping the best answer found so far.

### Solution

```python
def maxArea(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0
    while left < right:
        width = right - left
        max_area = max(max_area, min(height[left], height[right]) * width)
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return max_area
```

## 15. 3Sum [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

### Explanation

## 15. 3Sum [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Examples**

```tex
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```

**Constraints**
```tex
- 3 <= nums.length <= 3000
- -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```

## Explanation

### Strategy
Let's restate the problem: You're given an array of integers and need to find all unique triplets that sum to zero. This is a classic **three-pointer problem** that builds upon the two-sum concept.

This is a **sorting + two-pointer problem** that requires careful handling of duplicates and efficient searching.

**What is given?** An array of integers that may contain duplicates.

**What is being asked?** Find all unique triplets that sum to zero, avoiding duplicate combinations.

**Constraints:** The array can be up to 3000 elements long, with values ranging from -100,000 to 100,000.

**Edge cases:** 
- Array with all zeros
- Array with many duplicates
- Array with no valid triplets
- Array with exactly 3 elements

**High-level approach:**
The solution involves three main steps:
1. **Sort the array**: This allows us to use two-pointer technique efficiently
2. **Fix one element**: Iterate through each unique element as the first number
3. **Two-pointer search**: Use two pointers to find pairs that sum to the negative of the fixed element

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sort the array**: Enables efficient two-pointer searching and helps avoid duplicates
2. **Iterate through unique elements**: Fix each element as the first number in the triplet
3. **Two-pointer search**: Use left and right pointers to find pairs that sum to the target
4. **Handle duplicates**: Skip duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets
5. **Return results**: Collect all valid triplets

**Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**
- **Brute force**: Check all possible combinations of three numbers. This takes O(n³) time.
- **Optimized**: Sort the array and use two-pointer technique for each fixed element. This takes O(n²) time.

### Steps
Let's walk through the solution step by step using the first example: `nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`

**Step 1: Sort the array**
- Original: `[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`
- Sorted: `[-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]`

**Step 2: Fix first element and search for pairs**
- Fix `nums[0] = -4`
- Target for two-pointer search: `0 - (-4) = 4`
- Use two pointers: `left = 1`, `right = 5`
- `nums[left] + nums[right] = -1 + 2 = 1 < 4`, so move left pointer right
- `left = 2`, `nums[left] + nums[right] = -1 + 2 = 1 < 4`, so move left pointer right
- `left = 3`, `nums[left] + nums[right] = 0 + 2 = 2 < 4`, so move left pointer right
- `left = 4`, `nums[left] + nums[right] = 1 + 2 = 3 < 4`, so move left pointer right
- `left = 5`, but `left >= right`, so no valid pair found for `-4`

**Step 3: Fix next unique element**
- Fix `nums[1] = -1` (first occurrence)
- Target for two-pointer search: `0 - (-1) = 1`
- Use two pointers: `left = 2`, `right = 5`
- `nums[left] + nums[right] = -1 + 2 = 1 == 1`, found a triplet: `[-1,-1,2]`
- Move pointers: `left = 3`, `right = 4`
- `nums[left] + nums[right] = 0 + 1 = 1 == 1`, found another triplet: `[-1,0,1]`
- Continue until pointers cross

**Step 4: Skip duplicates**
- When moving to the next element, skip if it's the same as the previous one
- This prevents duplicate triplets

**Step 5: Continue for all elements**
- Repeat the process for each unique element
- Collect all valid triplets

**Why this works:**
By sorting the array, we can efficiently search for pairs using two pointers. For each fixed element `a`, we need to find pairs `b` and `c` such that `b + c = -a`. The two-pointer technique allows us to find these pairs in O(n) time for each fixed element, giving us an overall O(n²) solution.

> **Note:** The key insight is that sorting the array not only enables efficient searching but also helps us avoid duplicates by skipping identical elements.

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) - we iterate through each element and for each, we do a two-pointer search  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - we only use a constant amount of extra space (excluding the output array)

### Solution

```python
def threeSum(nums):
    """
    Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
    
    Args:
        nums: List[int] - Array of integers
        
    Returns:
        List[List[int]] - List of unique triplets that sum to zero
    """
    # Handle edge cases
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return []
    
    # Sort the array to enable two-pointer technique
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each element as the first number in the triplet
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        # Skip duplicates to avoid duplicate triplets
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        
        # Use two pointers to find pairs that sum to -nums[i]
        left = i + 1
        right = len(nums) - 1
        target = -nums[i]
        
        while left < right:

            if current_sum == target:

                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                
                # Skip duplicates for left pointer
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                
                # Skip duplicates for right pointer
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                
                # Move both pointers
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
            elif current_sum < target:
                # Sum is too small, move left pointer right
                left += 1
            else:
                # Sum is too large, move right pointer left
                right -= 1
    
    return result

## 42. Trapping Rain Water [Hard]
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

### Explanation

## 42. Trapping Rain Water [Hard]

https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water

## Description
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Examples**

```text
Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints**
```text
- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
```

## Explanation

### Strategy
Let's restate the problem: You're given an array representing the heights of walls in a landscape. When it rains, water gets trapped between these walls. Your job is to calculate how much water can be trapped.

This is a **two-pointer and dynamic programming problem** that requires understanding how water trapping works in real life.

**What is given?** An array of non-negative integers representing wall heights.

**What is being asked?** Calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped between the walls.

**Constraints:** The array can be quite large (up to 20,000 elements), so we need an efficient solution. All heights are non-negative.

**Edge cases:** 
- If the array has less than 3 elements, no water can be trapped (need at least 3 walls to form a container)
- If all heights are the same, no water can be trapped
- If heights are strictly increasing or decreasing, no water can be trapped

**High-level approach:**
The key insight is that for any position, the amount of water that can be trapped depends on the **minimum** of the highest wall to its left and the highest wall to its right. Water can only be trapped up to the height of the shorter of these two walls.

Think of it like this: at any point, water will rise to the level of the lower "dam" on either side. If you're in a valley between two mountains, the water level is limited by the shorter mountain.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Precompute left and right maximums**: For each position, find the highest wall to its left and right
2. **Calculate trapped water**: For each position, the trapped water is the minimum of left and right max, minus the current height (if positive)
3. **Sum up all trapped water**: Add up the water trapped at each position

**Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**
- **Brute force**: For each position, scan left and right to find maximums. This takes O(n²) time.
- **Optimized**: Precompute left and right maximums in two passes, then calculate water in one pass. This takes O(n) time.

### Steps
Let's walk through the solution step by step using the first example: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`

**Step 1: Understand the visualization**
Imagine this array as a landscape:
```
    ■
    ■   ■     ■
  ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■
■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1
```

**Step 2: Precompute left maximums**
We'll create an array `left_max` where `left_max[i]` is the highest wall to the left of position `i` (including position `i` itself).

```
height:    [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
left_max:  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

How we calculate this:
- `left_max[0] = height[0] = 0` (no walls to the left)
- `left_max[1] = max(left_max[0], height[1]) = max(0, 1) = 1`
- `left_max[2] = max(left_max[1], height[2]) = max(1, 0) = 1`
- `left_max[3] = max(left_max[2], height[3]) = max(1, 2) = 2`
- And so on...

**Step 3: Precompute right maximums**
Similarly, create `right_max` where `right_max[i]` is the highest wall to the right of position `i` (including position `i` itself).

```
height:     [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
right_max:  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]
```

How we calculate this (from right to left):
- `right_max[11] = height[11] = 1` (no walls to the right)
- `right_max[10] = max(right_max[11], height[10]) = max(1, 2) = 2`
- `right_max[9] = max(right_max[10], height[9]) = max(2, 1) = 2`
- And so on...

**Step 4: Calculate trapped water at each position**
For each position `i`, the water trapped is:
```
water[i] = min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]
```

But only if this value is positive (we can't have negative water).

Let's calculate for a few positions:
- Position 0: `min(0, 3) - 0 = 0` (no water trapped)
- Position 1: `min(1, 3) - 1 = 0` (no water trapped)
- Position 2: `min(1, 3) - 0 = 1` (1 unit of water trapped)
- Position 3: `min(2, 3) - 2 = 0` (no water trapped)
- Position 4: `min(2, 3) - 1 = 1` (1 unit of water trapped)
- Position 5: `min(2, 3) - 0 = 2` (2 units of water trapped)

**Step 5: Sum up all trapped water**
```
water = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
total = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6
```

> **Note:** The key insight is that water can only be trapped up to the height of the lower "dam" on either side. This is why we take the minimum of the left and right maximums.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - we make three passes through the array  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - we store two additional arrays of size n

### Solution

```python
def trap(height):
    """
    Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between walls.
    
    Args:
        height: List[int] - Array representing wall heights
        
    Returns:
        int - Total amount of water trapped
    """
    # Handle edge cases
    if not height or len(height) < 3:
        return 0
    
    n = len(height)
    
    # Step 1: Precompute left maximums
    # left_max[i] = highest wall to the left of position i (including i)
    left_max = [0] * n
    left_max[0] = height[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], height[i])
    
    # Step 2: Precompute right maximums
    # right_max[i] = highest wall to the right of position i (including i)
    right_max = [0] * n
    right_max[n-1] = height[n-1]
    
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], height[i])
    
    # Step 3: Calculate trapped water at each position
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Water trapped = min(left_max, right_max) - current_height
        # But only if positive (can't have negative water)
        water = min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]
        if water > 0:
            res += water
    
    return res
```

## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

### Explanation

## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence

## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Examples**

```tex
Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints**
```tex
- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```

## Explanation

### Strategy
Let's restate the problem: You're given an unsorted array of integers, and you need to find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The challenge is to do this in O(n) time, which means we can't sort the array (as sorting takes O(n log n) time).

This is a **hash table problem** that requires finding sequences of consecutive numbers efficiently by using the properties of consecutive sequences.

**What is given?** An unsorted array of integers that can be very large (up to 100,000 elements).

**What is being asked?** Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers.

**Constraints:** The array can be up to 100,000 elements long, with values ranging from -10⁹ to 10⁹.

**Edge cases:** 
- Empty array
- Array with single element
- Array with all identical elements
- Array with no consecutive sequences

**High-level approach:**
The solution involves using a hash set to quickly check if numbers exist, then for each number, expanding in both directions to find the complete consecutive sequence.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Convert array to hash set**: For O(1) lookup time
2. **Find sequence starting points**: Look for numbers that are the start of a consecutive sequence
3. **Expand sequences**: For each starting point, expand in both directions to find the complete sequence
4. **Track maximum length**: Keep track of the longest sequence found

**Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**
- **Brute force**: Sort the array and find consecutive sequences. This takes O(n log n) time.
- **Optimized**: Use hash set and expand sequences from starting points. This takes O(n) time.

### Steps
Let's walk through the solution step by step using the first example: `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`

**Step 1: Convert array to hash set**
- `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`
- `num_set = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}`

**Step 2: Find sequence starting points**
- For each number, check if it's the start of a consecutive sequence
- A number is a starting point if `num - 1` is NOT in the set
- Starting points: `[100, 200, 1]` (because 99, 199, and 0 are not in the set)

**Step 3: Expand sequences from starting points**
- **Starting point 100**: 
  - Check if 101 exists: No
  - Sequence length: 1
- **Starting point 200**: 
  - Check if 201 exists: No
  - Sequence length: 1
- **Starting point 1**: 
  - Check if 2 exists: Yes
  - Check if 3 exists: Yes
  - Check if 4 exists: Yes
  - Check if 5 exists: No
  - Sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - Sequence length: 4

**Step 4: Track maximum length**
- Maximum sequence length found: 4
- Result: 4

**Why this works:**
By identifying starting points (numbers that don't have a predecessor in the set), we ensure that we only expand each sequence once. This gives us O(n) time complexity because:
1. We visit each number at most twice (once when checking if it's a starting point, once when expanding sequences)
2. Each number is part of at most one sequence
3. The total work is bounded by O(n)

> **Note:** The key insight is identifying starting points of consecutive sequences and expanding from there. This avoids redundant work and ensures O(n) time complexity.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - we visit each number at most twice  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - we need to store the hash set

### Solution

```python
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Convert array to hash set for O(1) lookup
    num_set = set(nums)
    max_length = 0
    
    # For each number, check if it's the start of a consecutive sequence

### Explanation

# 141. Linked List Cycle [Easy]

https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle

## Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.


**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Explanation

### Strategy

This is a **two-pointer problem** that requires detecting a cycle in a linked list. The key insight is to use Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm), which uses two pointers moving at different speeds.

**Key observations:**
- If there's a cycle, a fast pointer will eventually catch up to a slow pointer
- If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end (null)
- The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer
- This approach uses O(1) space, which is optimal

**High-level approach:**
1. **Use two pointers**: Slow pointer (tortoise) and fast pointer (hare)
2. **Move pointers**: Slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps
3. **Check for cycle**: If fast catches slow, there's a cycle
4. **Check for end**: If fast reaches null, there's no cycle

### Steps

Let's break down the solution step by step:

**Step 1: Handle edge cases**
- If head is null or head.next is null, return false

**Step 2: Initialize pointers**
- `slow = head` (moves 1 step at a time)
- `fast = head.next` (moves 2 steps at a time)

**Step 3: Move pointers until they meet or reach end**
While `fast` is not null and `fast.next` is not null:
- Move slow pointer: `slow = slow.next`
- Move fast pointer: `fast = fast.next.next`
- If slow and fast meet, return true (cycle detected)

**Step 4: Return result**
- If you exit the loop, return false (no cycle)

**Example walkthrough:**
Let's trace through the first example:

```text
head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 (cycle from -4 back to 2)

Initial state:
slow = 3, fast = 2

Step 1: slow = 2, fast = 0
Step 2: slow = 0, fast = 2
Step 3: slow = -4, fast = 0
Step 4: slow = 2, fast = 2 (they meet!)

Result: Return true (cycle detected)
```

> **Note:** Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm is optimal because it uses O(1) space and O(n) time. The mathematical proof shows that if there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch the slow pointer within one cycle length.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - in the worst case, you visit each node at most twice  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - you only use two pointers regardless of input size

### Solution

```python
def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
```

## 146. LRU Cache [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

### Explanation

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **Least Recently Used (LRU) cache**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```raw
Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation:

LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
- `0 <= key <= 10^4`
- `0 <= value <= 10^5`
- At most `2 * 10^5` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

## Explanation

### Strategy

This is a **design problem** that requires implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. The key insight is to combine a hash map for O(1) lookups with a doubly linked list for O(1) insertions/deletions to maintain the order of usage.

**Key observations:**

- We need O(1) time for both get and put operations
- We need to track the order of usage (most recently used to least recently used)
- When capacity is exceeded, we need to remove the least recently used item
- A hash map provides O(1) lookups, but doesn't maintain order
- A doubly linked list maintains order and allows O(1) insertions/deletions

**High-level approach:**

1. **Use a hash map**: For O(1) key-value lookups
2. **Use a doubly linked list**: To maintain usage order
3. **Combine both**: Hash map stores key -> node mappings
4. **Update order**: Move accessed items to front (most recently used)
5. **Evict LRU**: Remove from end when capacity exceeded

### Steps

Let's break down the solution step by step:

**Step 1: Design the data structure**

- `capacity`: Maximum number of items in cache
- `cache`: Hash map for key -> node mappings
- `head`: Dummy head node of doubly linked list
- `tail`: Dummy tail node of doubly linked list

**Step 2: Implement get operation**

- Check if key exists in hash map
- If not found, return -1
- If found, move node to front (most recently used)
- Return the value

**Step 3: Implement put operation**

- If key exists, update value and move to front
- If key doesn't exist:
  - Create new node
  - Add to front of list
  - Add to hash map
  - If capacity exceeded, remove LRU item (from end)

**Step 4: Helper methods**

- `_add_to_front(node)`: Add node to front of list
- `_remove_node(node)`: Remove node from list
- `_remove_lru()`: Remove least recently used item

**Example walkthrough:**

Let's trace through the example:

```raw
capacity = 2

put(1, 1): cache = {1=1}, list = [1]
put(2, 2): cache = {1=1, 2=2}, list = [2, 1]
get(1): return 1, list = [1, 2] (move 1 to front)
put(3, 3): cache = {1=1, 3=3}, list = [3, 1] (evict 2)
get(2): return -1 (not found)
put(4, 4): cache = {3=3, 4=4}, list = [4, 3] (evict 1)
get(1): return -1 (not found)
get(3): return 3, list = [3, 4]
get(4): return 4, list = [4, 3]
```

> **Note:** The doubly linked list with dummy head and tail nodes makes it easy to add/remove nodes at the beginning and end. The hash map provides O(1) access to any node, and the list maintains the order of usage.

**Time Complexity:** O(1) for both get and put operations  
**Space Complexity:** O(capacity) - we store at most capacity items

### Solution

```python
def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}  # key -> node mapping

        # Initialize doubly linked list with dummy nodes
        self.head = Node(0, 0)  # dummy head
        self.tail = Node(0, 0)  # dummy tail
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        # Check if key exists
        if key not in self.cache:
            return -1

        # Move node to front (most recently used)
        node = self.cache[key]
        self._remove_node(node)
        self._add_to_front(node)

        return node.value

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        # If key exists, update value and move to front
        if key in self.cache:
            node = self.cache[key]
            node.value = value
            self._remove_node(node)
            self._add_to_front(node)
        else:
            # Create new node
            node = Node(key, value)
            self.cache[key] = node
            self._add_to_front(node)

            # If capacity exceeded, remove LRU item
            if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
                self._remove_lru()

    def _add_to_front(self, node):
        """Add node to front of list (after dummy head)"""
        node.next = self.head.next
        node.prev = self.head
        self.head.next.prev = node
        self.head.next = node

    def _remove_node(self, node):
        """Remove node from list"""
        node.prev.next = node.next
        node.next.prev = node.prev

    def _remove_lru(self):
        """Remove least recently used item (before dummy tail)"""
        lru_node = self.tail.prev
        self._remove_node(lru_node)
        del self.cache[lru_node.key]


class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```

## 148. Sort List [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/

### Explanation

Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the list after sorting it in **ascending order***.

**Example 1:**

```tex
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```tex
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**

```tex
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?

## Explanation

### Strategy

This is a **divide-and-conquer problem** that requires sorting a linked list in O(n log n) time and O(1) space. The key insight is to use merge sort, which naturally works well with linked lists and can be implemented in-place.

**Key observations:**
- We need O(n log n) time complexity for optimal sorting
- We need O(1) space complexity (no extra data structures)
- Merge sort is perfect for linked lists because we can split and merge in-place
- We can use the fast/slow pointer technique to find the middle

**High-level approach:**
1. **Find the middle**: Use fast/slow pointers to split the list
2. **Recursively sort**: Sort the left and right halves
3. **Merge sorted lists**: Merge the two sorted halves
4. **Return result**: Return the merged sorted list

### Steps

Let's break down the solution step by step:

**Step 1: Handle base cases**
- If head is null or head.next is null, return head (already sorted)

**Step 2: Find the middle of the list**
- Use fast/slow pointer technique
- Slow pointer moves 1 step, fast pointer moves 2 steps
- When fast reaches end, slow is at middle

**Step 3: Split the list**
- Set `mid = slow.next`
- Set `slow.next = None` to split the list

**Step 4: Recursively sort halves**

- Sort the left half: `left = sortList(head)`
- Sort the right half: `right = sortList(mid)`

**Step 5: Merge the sorted halves**

- Use a dummy node to simplify merging
- Compare nodes from both lists and link them in order

**Example walkthrough:**

Let's trace through the first example:

```tex
head = [4,2,1,3]

Step 1: Find middle
slow = 4, fast = 4
slow = 2, fast = 1
slow = 1, fast = 3
slow = 3, fast = null
middle = 3

Step 2: Split list
left = [4,2,1], right = [3]

Step 3: Recursively sort left
left = [4,2,1] → [1,2,4]

Step 4: Recursively sort right
right = [3] → [3]

Step 5: Merge [1,2,4] and [3]
result = [1,2,3,4]
```

> **Note:** Merge sort is ideal for linked lists because we can split and merge in-place without extra space. The fast/slow pointer technique efficiently finds the middle, and the merge step can be done by simply relinking nodes.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - merge sort time complexity  
**Space Complexity:** O(log n) - recursion stack space (not O(1) due to recursion)

### Solution

```python
def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        # Find the middle of the list
        slow = head
        fast = head.next

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Split the list
        mid = slow.next
        slow.next = None

        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(mid)

        return self.merge(left, right)

    def merge(
        self, left: Optional[ListNode], right: Optional[ListNode]
    ) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Create a dummy node to simplify merging
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy

        # Merge the two sorted lists
        while left and right:
            if left.val <= right.val:
                current.next = left
                left = left.next
            else:
                current.next = right
                right = right.next
            current = current.next

        # Attach remaining nodes
        if left:
            current.next = left
        if right:
            current.next = right

        # Return the merged list (skip dummy node)
        return dummy.next
```

## 242. Valid Anagram [Easy]
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

### Explanation

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

**Examples**

```tex
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

**Constraints**
```tex
- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters
```

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

## Explanation

### Strategy
Let's restate the problem: You're given two strings, and you need to determine if one is an anagram of the other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

This is a **character counting problem** that can be solved using hash tables to track the frequency of each character in both strings.

**What is given?** Two strings `s` and `t` of potentially different lengths.

**What is being asked?** Determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

**Constraints:** The strings can be up to 50,000 characters long and contain only lowercase English letters.

**Edge cases:** 
- Strings of different lengths
- Empty strings
- Strings with repeated characters
- Strings with all identical characters

**High-level approach:**
The solution involves counting the frequency of each character in both strings and comparing them. If the character counts match exactly, the strings are anagrams.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Check length equality**: If strings have different lengths, they can't be anagrams
2. **Count characters in first string**: Use a hash table to track character frequencies
3. **Decrement counts for second string**: For each character in the second string, decrement its count
4. **Verify all counts are zero**: If any count is not zero, the strings are not anagrams

**Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**
- **Brute force**: Try all possible permutations of one string. This takes O(n!) time.
- **Optimized**: Use character counting with hash tables. This takes O(n) time.

### Steps
Let's walk through the solution step by step using the first example: `s = "anagram"`, `t = "nagaram"`

**Step 1: Check string lengths**
- `s.length = 7`, `t.length = 7`
- Lengths match ✓

**Step 2: Initialize character count dictionary**
- `char_count = {}`

**Step 3: Count characters in first string (s)**
- `s = "anagram"`
- `char_count['a'] = 3` (appears 3 times)
- `char_count['n'] = 1` (appears 1 time)
- `char_count['g'] = 1` (appears 1 time)
- `char_count['r'] = 1` (appears 1 time)
- `char_count['m'] = 1` (appears 1 time)

**Step 4: Decrement counts for second string (t)**
- `t = "nagaram"`
- `t[0] = 'n'`: `char_count['n'] = 1 - 1 = 0`
- `t[1] = 'a'`: `char_count['a'] = 3 - 1 = 2`
- `t[2] = 'g'`: `char_count['g'] = 1 - 1 = 0`
- `t[3] = 'a'`: `char_count['a'] = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `t[4] = 'r'`: `char_count['r'] = 1 - 1 = 0`
- `t[5] = 'a'`: `char_count['a'] = 1 - 1 = 0`
- `t[6] = 'm'`: `char_count['m'] = 1 - 1 = 0`

**Step 5: Verify all counts are zero**
- All character counts are now 0
- The strings are anagrams: `true`

**Why this works:**
By counting characters in the first string and then decrementing for the second string, we ensure that:
1. Both strings contain the same characters
2. Each character appears the same number of times in both strings
3. The final count of 0 for all characters confirms the anagram property

> **Note:** The key insight is using character frequency counting to verify that both strings contain exactly the same characters with the same frequencies. This is much more efficient than trying to find permutations.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - we visit each character once in each string  
**Space Complexity:** O(k) - where k is the number of unique characters (bounded by the character set size)

### Solution

```python
def isAnagram(s, t):
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    
    char_count = {}
    
    for char in s:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in t:
        if char not in char_count:
            return False
        
        char_count[char] -= 1
        
        # If count becomes negative, strings are not anagrams
        if char_count[char] < 0:
            return False
    
    # Check if all counts are zero
    for count in char_count.values():
        if count != 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```

## 647. Palindromic Substrings [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/

### Explanation

## 647. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element [Medium]

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element

## Description
Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

**Examples**
```text
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.
```
**Constraints**
```text
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```

## Hint
Use a sliding window to keep at most one zero in the window.

## Explanation
We want the longest run of 1's after deleting one element. That means we can have at most one zero in our current window, since deleting it would leave only 1's.

We use a sliding window to keep track of the current sequence. Every time we have more than one zero, we move the left end of the window forward until we're back to at most one zero.

We do this because it lets us efficiently find the longest possible sequence without checking every possible subarray. By only moving the window when needed, we keep our solution fast and memory-efficient, especially for large arrays.

### Solution

```python
def longestSubarray(nums):
    left = 0
    zeros = 0
    max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[right] == 0:
            zeros += 1
        while zeros > 1:
            if nums[left] == 0:
                zeros -= 1
            left += 1
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left)
    return max_len
```
