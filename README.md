# LeetCode Apps Sources

This repository is the canonical source for LeetCode explanations and solutions used in the [LeetCode Learn App](https://leetcode-learn.web.app).

- Each problem has its own folder for solutions and explanations. Most of Leetode problems could be resolved by implementing one or any known patterns defined in [data/problem-patterns.json](data/problem-patterns.json)
- Book sets (playlists) are defined in `data/book-sets.json` and can be used to generate custom study plans in the app.
- Run `python scripts/generate_solutions.py` to generate a markdown book for any set.
