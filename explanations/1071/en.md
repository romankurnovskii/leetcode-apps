## Explanation

To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings, we check if there is a string that can be concatenated multiple times to form both input strings. If str1 + str2 == str2 + str1, then such a string exists. The length of the GCD string is the greatest common divisor of the lengths of str1 and str2. We return the prefix of that length from either string.

## Hint

Check if concatenating the strings in both orders gives the same result. Use the GCD of the lengths to find the answer.

## Points

- If str1 + str2 != str2 + str1, there is no common divisor string.
- Use math.gcd to compute the length of the answer.
- Time complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings.
