## Explanation

### Strategy (The "Why")

Given the root of a binary tree, we need to find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**1.1 Constraints & Complexity:**

- **Input Size:** The number of nodes $N$ in the tree can be between $0$ and $10^4$.
- **Value Range:** Node values are between $-100$ and $100$.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ - We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(h)$ where $h$ is the height of the tree. In the worst case (skewed tree), $h = n$, so $O(n)$. In the average case (balanced tree), $h = \log n$, so $O(\log n)$.
- **Edge Case:** If the tree is empty (root is null), return 0.

**1.2 High-level approach:**

The goal is to find the maximum depth of a binary tree.

![Maximum Depth](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)

We use recursion: the maximum depth of a tree is 1 plus the maximum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.

**1.3 Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**

- **Brute Force:** There isn't really a brute force approach - we must traverse the tree to find the depth.
- **Optimized Strategy (Recursion):** Recursively compute the depth of left and right subtrees, then return 1 plus the maximum. This is the natural and efficient approach.
- **Why it's better:** Recursion naturally follows the tree structure. Each node's depth depends only on its children's depths, creating optimal substructure.

**1.4 Decomposition:**

1. Base case: if the root is null, return 0.
2. Recursively find the maximum depth of the left subtree.
3. Recursively find the maximum depth of the right subtree.
4. Return 1 (for current node) plus the maximum of the two subtree depths.

### Steps (The "How")

**2.1 Initialization & Example Setup:**

Let's use the example: root = $[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]$

The tree structure:
```
    3
   / \
  9   20
     /  \
    15   7
```

**2.2 Start Recursion:**

We begin from the root node (value 3).

**2.3 Trace Walkthrough:**

| Node | Left Depth | Right Depth | Max Depth | Return Value |
|------|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 3 | ? | ? | - | Compute... |
| 9 | 0 (null) | 0 (null) | 0 | $0 + 1 = 1$ |
| 20 | ? | ? | - | Compute... |
| 15 | 0 (null) | 0 (null) | 0 | $0 + 1 = 1$ |
| 7 | 0 (null) | 0 (null) | 0 | $0 + 1 = 1$ |
| 20 | 1 | 1 | 1 | $1 + 1 = 2$ |
| 3 | 1 | 2 | 2 | $2 + 1 = 3$ |

**2.4 Recursion Flow:**

- Root (3): left depth = 1, right depth = 2, return $max(1, 2) + 1 = 3$
- Node 9: both children null, return $0 + 1 = 1$
- Node 20: left depth = 1, right depth = 1, return $max(1, 1) + 1 = 2$

**2.5 Return Result:**

We return 3, which is the maximum depth of the tree.

> **Note:** The recursive approach naturally handles the tree structure. The depth of each node is computed from its children's depths, working from the leaves upward to the root.
