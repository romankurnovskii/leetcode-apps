## Explanation

### Strategy (The "Why")

Given the head of a singly linked list, we need to return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second one.

**1.1 Constraints & Complexity:**

- **Input Size:** The number of nodes can be between $1$ and $100$.
- **Value Range:** Node values are between $1$ and $100$.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ - We traverse the list once with two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ - We only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.
- **Edge Case:** If the list has only one node, return that node. If the list has two nodes, return the second one.

**1.2 High-level approach:**

The goal is to find the middle node of a linked list.

We use the "tortoise and hare" approach: one pointer moves one step at a time (slow), and another moves two steps at a time (fast). When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer is at the middle.

**1.3 Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**

- **Brute Force:** First pass to count nodes, second pass to find the middle node. This takes $O(n)$ time but requires two passes.
- **Optimized Strategy (Two Pointers):** Use two pointers moving at different speeds. This takes $O(n)$ time in a single pass.
- **Why it's better:** The two-pointer approach finds the middle in one pass instead of two, making it more efficient and elegant.

**1.4 Decomposition:**

1. Initialize two pointers (slow and fast) at the head.
2. Move slow one step and fast two steps at a time.
3. When fast reaches the end (null or last node), slow is at the middle.
4. Return the slow pointer.

### Steps (The "How")

**2.1 Initialization & Example Setup:**

Let's use the example: $head = [1,2,3,4,5]$

We initialize:
- `slow = 1`
- `fast = 1`

**2.2 Start Processing:**

We begin moving the pointers.

**2.3 Trace Walkthrough:**

| Step | slow position | fast position | Action |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | Start |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | Move slow 1, fast 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 5 | Move slow 1, fast 2 |
| 3 | 3 | null | fast.next is null, stop |

**2.4 Explanation:**

- When fast reaches the end (node 5, where fast.next is null), slow is at node 3, which is the middle node.

**2.5 Return Result:**

We return the node with value 3, which is the middle node.

> **Note:** The key insight is that when the fast pointer moves twice as fast, it covers twice the distance. When it reaches the end, the slow pointer has covered half the distance, which is exactly the middle.
