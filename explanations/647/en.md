> **Hint:**  Use a sliding window to keep at most one zero in the window.

### Explanation

We want the longest run of 1's after deleting one element. That means we can have at most one zero in our current window, since deleting it would leave only 1's.

We use a sliding window to keep track of the current sequence. Every time we have more than one zero, we move the left end of the window forward until we're back to at most one zero.

We do this because it lets us efficiently find the longest possible sequence without checking every possible subarray. By only moving the window when needed, we keep our solution fast and memory-efficient, especially for large arrays.
