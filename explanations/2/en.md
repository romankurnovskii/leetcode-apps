## Add Two Numbers [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
```

## Explanation

The Add Two Numbers problem involves adding two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. To solve this, we iterate through both linked lists, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition. We create a new linked list to store the result. If one list is shorter, treat missing digits as 0. If there is a carry left after processing both lists, add a new node with the carry value.

## Hint

Use a dummy head node to simplify the code for building the result list. Remember to handle the carry at the end.

## Points

- Time complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.
- Handle different lengths of input lists.
- Donâ€™t forget to add a node if there is a carry left after the main loop.
- Each node contains a single digit (0-9).
