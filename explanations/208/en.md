## Explanation

### Strategy (The "Why")

We need to implement a Trie (prefix tree) data structure that supports inserting words, searching for complete words, and checking if any word starts with a given prefix.

**1.1 Constraints & Complexity:**

- **Input Size:** The number of operations $N$ can be up to $3 \times 10^4$.
- **Value Range:** Words and prefixes consist of lowercase English letters only, with length between 1 and 2000.
- **Time Complexity:** 
  - `insert`: $O(m)$ where $m$ is the length of the word
  - `search`: $O(m)$ where $m$ is the length of the word
  - `startsWith`: $O(m)$ where $m$ is the length of the prefix
- **Space Complexity:** $O(ALPHABET\_SIZE \times N \times M)$ where $N$ is the number of words and $M$ is the average length. In practice, this is $O(\text{total characters in all words})$.
- **Edge Case:** Searching for an empty string should return false (unless an empty word was inserted). Checking prefix of empty string should return true if any word exists.

**1.2 High-level approach:**

The goal is to implement a Trie data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves words.

![Trie Structure](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/trie-1.png)

A Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character. Words that share common prefixes share the same path in the tree. This makes prefix searches very efficient.

**1.3 Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**

- **Brute Force:** Store all words in a list. For search and prefix operations, iterate through all words checking each one. This takes $O(n \times m)$ time where $n$ is the number of words.
- **Optimized Strategy (Trie):** Use a tree structure where each node has children representing possible next characters. This allows us to search in $O(m)$ time regardless of how many words are stored.
- **Why it's better:** The Trie structure eliminates the need to check every word. We only traverse the path relevant to the word or prefix we're looking for, making it much more efficient for large datasets.

**1.4 Decomposition:**

1. Create a `TrieNode` class with a dictionary of children and a flag indicating if it's the end of a word.
2. Initialize the Trie with a root `TrieNode`.
3. For `insert`: Traverse the tree, creating nodes as needed, and mark the final node as an end-of-word.
4. For `search`: Traverse the tree following the word's characters. Return true only if we reach the end and the final node is marked as end-of-word.
5. For `startsWith`: Similar to search, but return true if we can traverse the entire prefix, regardless of whether it's a complete word.

### Steps (The "How")

**2.1 Initialization & Example Setup:**

Let's use the example operations:
- `insert("apple")`
- `search("apple")` → returns true
- `search("app")` → returns false
- `startsWith("app")` → returns true
- `insert("app")`
- `search("app")` → returns true

We initialize:
- A root `TrieNode` with empty children dictionary
- `is_end = False` for all nodes initially

**2.2 Start Inserting:**

We begin by inserting "apple".

**2.3 Trace Walkthrough:**

**Insert "apple":**

| Step | Current Node | Character | Action | New Node Created? |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | root | 'a' | Create node for 'a' | Yes |
| 2 | a-node | 'p' | Create node for 'p' | Yes |
| 3 | p-node | 'p' | Create node for 'p' | Yes |
| 4 | p-node | 'l' | Create node for 'l' | Yes |
| 5 | l-node | 'e' | Create node for 'e', mark as end | Yes |

**Search "apple":**

| Step | Current Node | Character | Found? | Action |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | root | 'a' | Yes | Move to 'a' node |
| 2 | a-node | 'p' | Yes | Move to 'p' node |
| 3 | p-node | 'p' | Yes | Move to 'p' node |
| 4 | p-node | 'l' | Yes | Move to 'l' node |
| 5 | l-node | 'e' | Yes | Check is_end → true → Return true |

**Search "app":**

| Step | Current Node | Character | Found? | Action |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | root | 'a' | Yes | Move to 'a' node |
| 2 | a-node | 'p' | Yes | Move to 'p' node |
| 3 | p-node | 'p' | Yes | Check is_end → false → Return false |

**startsWith "app":**

| Step | Current Node | Character | Found? | Action |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | root | 'a' | Yes | Move to 'a' node |
| 2 | a-node | 'p' | Yes | Move to 'p' node |
| 3 | p-node | 'p' | Yes | All characters found → Return true |

**2.4 Insert "app" and Search Again:**

After inserting "app", the second 'p' node now has `is_end = true`. So searching "app" will now return true.

**2.5 Return Result:**

The Trie correctly handles all operations, allowing efficient word storage and prefix matching.

> **Note:** The key difference between `search` and `startsWith` is that `search` requires the final node to be marked as an end-of-word, while `startsWith` only requires that the path exists.
