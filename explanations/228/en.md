## 228. Summary Ranges [Easy]

https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges

## Description
You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

A **range** `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Return *the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in the array exactly***. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

- `"a->b"` if `a != b`
- `"a"` if `a == b`

**Examples**

```tex
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"
```

**Constraints**
```tex
- 0 <= nums.length <= 20
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
- All the values of nums are unique
- nums is sorted in ascending order
```

## Explanation

### Strategy
Let's restate the problem: You're given a sorted array of unique integers, and you need to create a summary of consecutive ranges. The goal is to represent consecutive sequences as ranges (e.g., "0->2") and single numbers as themselves (e.g., "7").

This is an **array traversal problem** that requires identifying consecutive sequences and formatting them appropriately.

**What is given?** A sorted array of unique integers (up to 20 elements).

**What is being asked?** Create a list of ranges that cover all numbers exactly, representing consecutive sequences as ranges and single numbers as themselves.

**Constraints:** The array is small (up to 20 elements), sorted, and contains unique values.

**Edge cases:** 
- Empty array
- Single element array
- Array with no consecutive sequences
- Array with all consecutive sequences

**High-level approach:**
The solution involves traversing the array and identifying consecutive sequences. When we find a break in the sequence, we format the range appropriately and continue.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Handle edge cases**: Empty array returns empty list
2. **Initialize variables**: Track start of current range and result list
3. **Traverse array**: Look for consecutive sequences
4. **Format ranges**: Convert consecutive sequences to appropriate string format
5. **Handle final range**: Don't forget the last range when loop ends

**Brute force vs. optimized strategy:**
- **Brute force**: Check each possible range combination. This is inefficient.
- **Optimized**: Single pass through the array, identifying consecutive sequences as we go. This takes O(n) time.

### Steps
Let's walk through the solution step by step using the first example: `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]`

**Step 1: Handle edge case**
- Array is not empty, continue

**Step 2: Initialize variables**
- `start = 0` (start of current range)
- `result = []` (list to store ranges)

**Step 3: Traverse array looking for consecutive sequences**
- `i = 0`: `nums[0] = 0`
  - Start new range: `start = 0`
- `i = 1`: `nums[1] = 1`
  - Check if consecutive: `1 == 0 + 1` ✓
  - Continue current range
- `i = 2`: `nums[2] = 2`
  - Check if consecutive: `2 == 1 + 1` ✓
  - Continue current range
- `i = 3`: `nums[3] = 4`
  - Check if consecutive: `4 == 2 + 1` ✗
  - Break in sequence! Format range [0,2] as "0->2"
  - Add to result: `result = ["0->2"]`
  - Start new range: `start = 3`
- `i = 4`: `nums[4] = 5`
  - Check if consecutive: `5 == 4 + 1` ✓
  - Continue current range
- `i = 5`: `nums[5] = 7`
  - Check if consecutive: `7 == 5 + 1` ✗
  - Break in sequence! Format range [4,5] as "4->5"
  - Add to result: `result = ["0->2", "4->5"]`
  - Start new range: `start = 5`

**Step 4: Handle final range**
- Loop ended, need to handle the last range [7,7]
- Since start == end (7 == 7), format as "7"
- Add to result: `result = ["0->2", "4->5", "7"]`

**Step 5: Return result**
- Final result: `["0->2","4->5","7"]`

**Why this works:**
By traversing the array once and checking for consecutive numbers, we can identify ranges efficiently. The key insights are:
1. A break in the sequence occurs when `nums[i] != nums[i-1] + 1`
2. Single numbers (where start == end) are formatted as "a"
3. Ranges (where start != end) are formatted as "a->b"

> **Note:** The key insight is identifying consecutive sequences by checking if each number is exactly one more than the previous number. This allows us to build ranges efficiently in a single pass.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - we visit each element once  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - we need to store the result list
