> **Hint:**  Use two pointers, one at each end, and move the pointer with the shorter line inward.

### Explanation

Imagine the array as a row of sticks of different heights. You want to pick two sticks that, together with the x-axis, can hold the most water. The area is determined by the shorter stick and the distance between them. Start with the two ends and move the pointer pointing to the shorter stick inward, always looking for a bigger area.

This approach is efficient because it checks all possible pairs in linear time, always keeping the best answer found so far.
