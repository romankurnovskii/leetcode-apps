# 141. Linked List Cycle

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

## Problem Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Explanation

### Strategy

This is a **two-pointer problem** that requires detecting a cycle in a linked list. The key insight is to use Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm), which uses two pointers moving at different speeds.

**Key observations:**
- If there's a cycle, a fast pointer will eventually catch up to a slow pointer
- If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end (null)
- The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer
- This approach uses O(1) space, which is optimal

**High-level approach:**
1. **Use two pointers**: Slow pointer (tortoise) and fast pointer (hare)
2. **Move pointers**: Slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps
3. **Check for cycle**: If fast catches slow, there's a cycle
4. **Check for end**: If fast reaches null, there's no cycle

### Steps

Let's break down the solution step by step:

**Step 1: Handle edge cases**
- If head is null or head.next is null, return false

**Step 2: Initialize pointers**
- `slow = head` (moves 1 step at a time)
- `fast = head.next` (moves 2 steps at a time)

**Step 3: Move pointers until they meet or reach end**
While `fast` is not null and `fast.next` is not null:
- Move slow pointer: `slow = slow.next`
- Move fast pointer: `fast = fast.next.next`
- If slow and fast meet, return true (cycle detected)

**Step 4: Return result**
- If we exit the loop, return false (no cycle)

**Example walkthrough:**
Let's trace through the first example:

```
head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 (cycle from -4 back to 2)

Initial state:
slow = 3, fast = 2

Step 1: slow = 2, fast = 0
Step 2: slow = 0, fast = 2
Step 3: slow = -4, fast = 0
Step 4: slow = 2, fast = 2 (they meet!)

Result: Return true (cycle detected)
```

> **Note:** Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm is optimal because it uses O(1) space and O(n) time. The mathematical proof shows that if there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch the slow pointer within one cycle length.

### Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        # Handle edge cases
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        # Initialize two pointers
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        # Move pointers until they meet or reach end
        while fast and fast.next:
            # If pointers meet, there's a cycle
            if slow == fast:
                return True
            
            # Move slow pointer one step
            slow = slow.next
            
            # Move fast pointer two steps
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # If we reach here, there's no cycle
        return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - in the worst case, we visit each node at most twice  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - we only use two pointers regardless of input size
